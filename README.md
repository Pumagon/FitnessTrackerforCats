# FitnessTrackerforCats

My project is a fitness tracker designed specially for cats, using a Raspberry Pi, an accelerometer, and a small display. The Raspberry Pi acts as the central processing unit, collecting and processing data that comes from accelerometer which monitors the cat's movement. The tiny display provides real-time data and the total data of the cat's physical activity and is also uploaded to Kintone, allowing for pet owner to easily track the cat's activity.
